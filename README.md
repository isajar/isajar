Software engineer passionate about disruptive technology solutions that change the market paradigm.

Always trying to see problems from different perspectives to find the simplest solution and keep things simple. If I start something I follow it to the end.

I am one of those who prefers to know little, of many things, than to know a lot, of only one thing.

I love interdisciplinary work and in my life I have had the opportunity to dialogue with engineering, software, economics and finance.

Some time ago I found a hobby in the financial market, especially in the world of cryptos and decentralized finance (DEFI's), which I combine with data science and machine learning.

I always try to set aside time in my week to help other people who need it, especially older people who are alone.

Healthy living and training are essential in my routine.
